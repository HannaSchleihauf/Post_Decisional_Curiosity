## Directory Structure

There are two main folders for this project: chimpanzees and children.  

1. [`chimpanzees`](https://github.com/HannaSchleihauf/Post_Decisional_Curiosity/tree/master/chimpanzees):
In the folder chimpanzees, you can find subfolders for Study 1A and 2A.  

These folders contain the csv file with the chimpanzee data for Study 1A and 2A:  

[`data - Study 1A - chimpanzees`](https://github.com/HannaSchleihauf/Post_Decisional_Curiosity/tree/master/chimpanzees/study1/data)  

[`data - Study 2A - chimpanzees`](https://github.com/HannaSchleihauf/Post_Decisional_Curiosity/tree/master/chimpanzees/study2/data)  

These folders contain all functions used in the analysis scripts for Study 1A and 2A:  

[`functions - Study 1A - chimpanzees`](https://github.com/HannaSchleihauf/Post_Decisional_Curiosity/tree/master/chimpanzees/study1/functions)  

[`functions - Study 2A - chimpanzees`](https://github.com/HannaSchleihauf/Post_Decisional_Curiosity/tree/master/chimpanzees/study2/functions)  

These folders contain all plots produced for Study 1A and 2A:  

[`plots - Study 1A - chimpanzees`](https://github.com/HannaSchleihauf/Post_Decisional_Curiosity/tree/master/chimpanzees/study1/plots)  

[`plots - Study 2A - chimpanzees`](https://github.com/HannaSchleihauf/Post_Decisional_Curiosity/tree/master/chimpanzees/study2/plots)  

These folders contain the R image which contains all objects that were created with the scripts. Since some of the code (especially the bootstraps) take a long time to run, it mightbe useful to load the image at the beginning of the script:  

[`R_objects - Study 1A - chimpanzees`](https://github.com/HannaSchleihauf/Post_Decisional_Curiosity/tree/master/chimpanzees/study1/plots)  

[`R_objects - Study 2A - chimpanzees`](https://github.com/HannaSchleihauf/Post_Decisional_Curiosity/tree/master/chimpanzees/study2/plots)  

This folder contains the R script for the analysis and also power analyses of Study 1A and 2A:  

[`script - Study 1A - chimpanzees`](https://github.com/HannaSchleihauf/Post_Decisional_Curiosity/tree/master/chimpanzees/study1/scripts)  

[`script - Study 2A - chimpanzees`](https://github.com/HannaSchleihauf/Post_Decisional_Curiosity/tree/master/chimpanzees/study2/scripts)  
  
  
2.  [`children`](https://github.com/HannaSchleihauf/Post_Decisional_Curiosity/tree/master/children):
    In the folder children, you can the subfolders for Study 1B and 2B.  
    
These folders contain the csv file with the chimpanzee data for Study 1A and 2A:  

[`data - Study 1B - children`](https://github.com/HannaSchleihauf/Post_Decisional_Curiosity/tree/master/children/study1/data)  

[`data - Study 2B - children`](https://github.com/HannaSchleihauf/Post_Decisional_Curiosity/tree/master/children/study2/data)  

These folders contain all functions used in the analysis scripts for Study 1A and 2A:  

[`functions - Study 1B - children`](https://github.com/HannaSchleihauf/Post_Decisional_Curiosity/tree/master/children/study1/functions)  

[`functions - Study 2B - children`](https://github.com/HannaSchleihauf/Post_Decisional_Curiosity/tree/master/children/study2/functions)  

These folders contain all plots produced for Study 1A and 2A:  

[`plots - Study 1B - children`](https://github.com/HannaSchleihauf/Post_Decisional_Curiosity/tree/master/children/study1/plots)  

[`plots - Study 2B - children`](https://github.com/HannaSchleihauf/Post_Decisional_Curiosity/tree/master/children/study2/plots)  

These folders contain the R image which contains all objects that were created with the scripts. Since some of the code (especially the bootstraps) take a long time to run, it mightbe useful to load the image at the beginning of the script:

This folder contains the R script for the analysis and also power analyses of Study 1A and 2A:  

[`script - Study 1B - children`](https://github.com/HannaSchleihauf/Post_Decisional_Curiosity/tree/master/children/study1/scripts)  

[`script - Study 2B - children`](https://github.com/HannaSchleihauf/Post_Decisional_Curiosity/tree/master/children/study2/scripts)
